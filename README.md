**HeaderMod - Inject, update, edit, modify, override HTTP headers**

A lightweight and open source browser extension that lets you intercept outgoing HTTP requests and inject, update, edit, modify, or override headers on a per-URL basis.

**Key Features**

* Define multiple header-modification rules
* Wildcard-based URL matching (e.g., *.example.com/*)
* Add or replace any request header (name + value)
* Enable or disable rules individually
* Persist rules in local storage for seamless browser restarts
* Dynamic toolbar icon indicates active rules

**Usage**

1.	Click the HeaderMod toolbar icon to open the popup.
2.	Click Add Rule to create a new entry, then fill in:
	* Header-Name and Header-Value
	* Optional URL Pattern (supports * wildcards)
	* Optional Notes for your reference
	* Enabled checkbox to toggle the rule
3.	Modify or delete rules as needed.

**What happens next**

* Browse your sites as usual
* Each enabled rule is tested against the request URL
* Matching requests have their headers updated or appended before they leave the browser

**Privacy**

* HeaderMod does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All settings remain in your browserâ€™s local storage and are never sent to any external server.

Whether you need to spoof headers for testing or inject custom metadata into requests, HeaderMod puts you in control.
